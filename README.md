</p>

<p>
A handwriting detection system using TensorFlow and a combination of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithms to train the RNN model. The RNN used in this project is Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is a type of RNN used specifically for image recognition. 
  
The effectiveness of the use of CTC for handwritten text recognition has been proven by Harald Scheidl in his thesis on "Handwritten Text Recognition in Historial documents." https://repositum.tuwien.at/retrieve/10807

  ## Installation
### Directly 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Or
### Use a Virtual Environment

```bash
    virtualenv <virtual_environment_name>

## üî® Usage
    
<a id="main"></a>
### 1) Main.py
*This file contains the code for Tkinter GUI which is used to test or predict the text. This takes images of handwritten text as input.*

<a id="model"></a>                           
### 2) Model.py
*This file contains the structure of the model that is used in this project.*
  
<a id="preprocess"></a>                           
### 3) Preprocessor.py
*This file handles the preprocessing that needs to be done. It downsizes the inputs to either a width of 128 or height of 32 (without affecting it's quality).* 
              
<a id="test"></a>                           
### 4) testing_code.py
*This file contains the "infer" method which is used to initialize the testing or prediction of text.*
  
<a id="train"></a>                           
### 5) Training_model_code.py
*This file contains all the methods which are needed to build the model. This can be invoked using a command line argument and arguments.* 
  
<a id="lmdb"></a>                           
### 6) Create_lmdb.py
*This file initializes the Lighting Memory Mapped Database (lmdb) which is used to store the images in a tree format.*
  
<a id="dataset"></a>                           
### 7) Dataloader_iam.py
*This file contains the import of <a href="https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database">IAM</a> dataset and it's preprocessing and split between test, train and validation data.*
